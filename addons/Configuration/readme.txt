From this addons you can get the following features:

logs_ID:
    From this ID you can get the channel and send messages to it.

logs_Levels:
    This is the level of the logs.
    
    1 = Debug
    2 = Info
    3 = Warning
    4 = Error
    5 = Fatal

    When you send a log you can choose the level of the log.
    If the user set the level to 3, the logs with level 3, 4 and 5 will be sent to the channel.
    This is useful if you want to send only the errors to the channel.
